## Directions

Cook the noodles according to instructions. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook for the time mentioned on the package.

In a bowl combine the soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar and ginger. Mix well and set aside.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, chile, bell peppers and mushrooms and cook for 4 minutes. Stir occasionally.

Add the broccoli and other veggies if using and a dash of salt and black pepper and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes or until mushrooms are golden brown.

Add the sauce, cooked noodles to the skillet and mix in. Adjust heat if needed. I usually add a sprinkle of pepper flakes or sriracha and a good dash of freshly ground black pepper. Serve.
