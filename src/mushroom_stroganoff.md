## Notes

> Makes 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 1 kg chestnut mushrooms roughly sliced
- 2 red onions diced
- 4 garlic cloves crushed
- 2 400ml tins coconut milk
- 2 tsp dijon mustard (good quality)
- 2 tsp paprika
- Juice of 1 lemon
- Large handful fresh parsley
- 3 tbsp Olive/coconut oil
- Salt and pepper

## Optional Ingredients

- Brown rice

## Directions

Firstly prepare the garlic, onion and mushrooms.

Heat a large shallow pan (this helps to reduce the sauce down faster) with oil adding in the garlic, onion and mushrooms along with a decent pinch of salt and pepper. Cook down for 5 minutes making sure to stir often.

Once the mushrooms are soft add the coconut milk, mustard, paprika and lemon juice and stir well.

Cook on a high heat (this helps the sauce to thicken nicely) for 20-25 minutes or until desired consistency. Keep stirring every 5-10 minutes.

Finally add freshly chopped parsley and stir it into the stroganoff, leaving some to garnish for serving.

## Serve

- With brown rice
