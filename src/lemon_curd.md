# Lemon Curd

## Ingredients

- 100 g white sugar
- 15 ml cornstarch
- 118 g plant-based milk, (such as soy or almond)
- 61 g fresh lemon juice, (about 2 lemons)
- 2 teaspoons lemon zest, (from about 1 lemon)
- &#8539; teaspoon turmeric, (optional for colour)

## Directions

In a small pot, whisk together the sugar and cornstarch. Now mix in the non-dairy milk, lemon juice, lemon zest, and turmeric. Put over medium heat, whisking frequently, until the curd thickens, about 5 minutes. You may need to whisk vigorously as it thickens to ensure a smooth curd.
