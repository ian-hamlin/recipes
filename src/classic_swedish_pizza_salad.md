# Swedish Pizza Salad


## Ingredients

- 1 small white cabbage, very finely shredded (500g / roughly half a head)
- 3 tablespoons white wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar)
- 3 tablespoons olive oil (or rapeseed or sunflower oil)
- 1 tablespoon sugar (optional, to balance the vinegar)
- &#189; teaspoon black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon sea salt

## Method

Prepare the cabbage: Remove outer leaves and core. Finely shred the cabbage into a large bowl. A food processor, mandoline, or a sharp knife will work best for this.

Combine dressing ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper, oregano, and optional sugar until well combined.

Dress the salad: Pour the dressing over the shredded cabbage.

Massage and marinate: Using clean hands, massage the dressing into the cabbage for a few minutes. This helps soften the cabbage and allows it to absorb the flavors.

Rest and serve: Ideally, let the salad rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes, or preferably for a few hours or even overnight, for the best flavor and texture. Serve as a side dish to your pizza or other meals.

## Tip

Leftovers can be kept in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to a week.
