## Directions

In a large pan over medium heat, add 2 tablespoons of Mazola corn oil and cook the chopped tempeh, onion, minced garlic and dried thyme for 5-8 minutes or until fragrant and translucent.

Add chopped pepper, diced potato, and spices and cook until pepper and potato are soft.
Remove from heat and allow to cool a bit while you prepare the empanada dough.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees and lay your dough down on a floured flat surface. Cut the dough in half and roll out until it's thin but still sturdy, cut roughly 4 inch circles and place on a baking tray covered with parchment paper.

Repeat with remaining dough. Scoop roughly 2 tablespoon amounts of filling into the center of each circle, lightly wet all edges with water or oil and squeeze together. Use a fork to seal them as well.

Lightly brush all empanadas with 2-4 tablespoons corn oil and bake for 15-20 minutes - broil for the last few seconds or so until it browns nicely.
