## Ingredients

### Spring Rolls

- 2 large carrots
- 1 red bell pepper
- 1 avocado
- 1 mango
- &#189; cucumber
- &#189; jalapeño
- 2 cups arugula
- &#189; cup fresh basil
- &#189; cup fresh mint
- 6 to 8 rice paper spring roll wrappers

### Sauce

- &#189; cup salted roasted almonds
- &#189; cup canned coconut milk 120 mL
- 1 Tbsp lime juice 15 mL
- 1 Tbsp soy sauce 15 mL
- 1 Tbsp honey 15 g
- 3 cloves garlic

## Directions

Combine all “Sauce” ingredients in a blender until smooth.

Fill a shallow dish with warm water. Working one at a time, gently place a rice paper in the water for about 15 seconds, or until soft and pliable. Move the paper to a damp surface. Stack veggies and herbs on the rice paper in a long narrow row, leaving about 2 inches on either side. Fold the sides of the rice paper over the mound, then gently roll.
