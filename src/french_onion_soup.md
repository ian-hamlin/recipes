> Makes 3 servings

## Ingredients

- 3 pounds yellow onions - about 6 onions
- 4 tablespoons vegan butter
- 3 cloves garlic - minced
- &#8531; cup dry white wine - optional, sub veg stock if needed
- 1 litre vegetable stock
- 2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce
- 2 bay leaves
- &#189; teaspoon sage
- &#189; teaspoon thyme
- &#188; teaspoon black pepper
- salt to taste
- Slices of baguette - (or other crusty bread)
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- vegan cheese

## Directions

Peel and thinly slice the onions (about ¼ inch thick.)

Melt the butter on medium-high heat. Add the onions and give them a good toss with the butter.

Sauté until caramelized. Stir frequently.

Add in garlic and sauté for an additional 2 minutes.

Stir in the wine. Deglaze the pan and scrape up any brown bits stuck to the bottom.

Stir in the vegetable stock, Worcestershire sauce, bay leaves, sage, thyme, pepper, and salt.

Bring to a boil and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove the bay leaves.

In the meantime, pre-heat the grill at 280C. Brush each slice of baguette with olive oil. Place on a baking sheet and bake until brown and toasted.

Ladle the soup into individual oven-safe bowls. Place a toasted baguette on top and then add vegan cheese.

Broil until cheese is melty and browned, about 2-3 minutes.
