## Directions

Coat the bottom of a large pot with oil and place over medium heat. When oil is hot, add onion and bell pepper. Sauté until softened and onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and sauté about 1 minute more, until very fragrant.

Add beans, crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, chili powder, cumin, paprika and ancho chili powder to the pot and give it a stir to incorporate everything. Bring to a simmer.
Lower heat and allow to simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes. Add plantains and simmer 10 minutes more, stirring occasionally, until plantains are softened but not yet mushy.

Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Divide into bowls and top with toppings of choice. Serve.
