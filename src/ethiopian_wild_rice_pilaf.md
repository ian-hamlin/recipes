# Ethiopian Wild Rice Pilaf

## Notes

> Makes 4 servings

## Ingredients

- 2 medium leeks (white and light green parts), diced and rinsed
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- &#190; teaspoon berbere spice Blend, or to taste
- 4 cups cooked wild rice blend
- 2 cups cooked adzuki beans, or one 15-ounce can, drained and rinsed
- Zest of 1 orange
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
- 4 green onions (white and green parts), thinly sliced

## Directions

Place the leeks in a large saucepan, and saut√© over medium heat for 10 minutes. Add water 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time to keep the leeks from sticking to the pan.

Add the garlic and cook for 2 minutes. Add the berbere spice and cook for 30 seconds. Stir in the wild rice, beans, and orange zest, and season with salt and pepper. Cook until the mixture is heated through.

Garnish with the green onions.
