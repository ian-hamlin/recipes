- 100g cooked chestnuts
- 1 garlic clove, peeled and chopped

- Plain flour, to dust
- Hazelnut milk, to brush

## Directions

Preheat oven to 195°C

Merge the vegan burger patties into a thick sausage shape to make a fillet, wrap in cling film and place in the fridge to firm up.

For the duxelles, put all the ingredients (mushrooms, chestnuts, garlic and a pinch of salt) into a food processor and blend to a paste. Heat a large dry frying pan, add the mushroom paste and a few thyme leaves. Cook over a high heat, stirring every now and then. The paste needs to dried out otherwise the pastry gets soggy. Spread the mushroom paste out on a plate and cool. 4.

Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over a high heat, remove the cling film from the fillet and add searing the outside all over until evenly browned. Transfer to a plate and brush all over with mustard, then set aside.

Roll out a large piece of cling film and spread the mushroom mix on top. Lay the fillet at the edge of the mushroom layer. Tightly roll over the fillet into a sausage shape. Twist the ends of the cling film so it holds tightly together, then refrigerate for 15 minutes to firm up.

Roll out the pastry on a floured surface into a large rectangle, roughly the thickness of a £1 coin. Unwrap the fillet from the cling film and place on the edge of the pastry. Make sure you have a large enough rectangle to wrap the fillet up and trim off the excess pastry. Roll the pastry around the fillet and then press the edges to seal. Pinch the pastry at the ends to seal and trim off any excess. Wrap the wellington tightly in cling film and chill for another 10 minutes, or overnight if you’re super organised!

Remove the cling film and decorate the pastry with the off-cuts if you like. Glaze the wellington all over with hazelnut milk. Place on a baking tray, bake for about 45 minutes, serve with sides of roast veggies and delicious gravy.
