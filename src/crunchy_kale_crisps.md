# Crunchy Kale Crisps

## Ingredients

- 200g kale, thick stems removed

Preheat the oven to 140°C.

Tear the kale into similar-sized pieces and toss together with the olive oil until well coated. Spread out over a baking tray, making sure the leaves aren’t touching each other. Cook for 15 mins, then turn and cook for a further 15 mins until crisp.
