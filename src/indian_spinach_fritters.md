# Horchata

## Notes

> Makes 2 servings

## Ingredients

- 1 &#189; Cups Chickpea Flour
- 1 Tablespoon Ground Coriander
- 1 Tablespoon Ground Cumin
- &#189; onion, chopped
- 3 Birds Eye Chillies diced finely
- 4 cups of loose Baby Spinach chopped finely
- 1 teaspoon Sea Salt more/less to taste

## Directions

Combine chickpea flour, coriander, cumin and salt in a bowl. Whisk to combine.

Add chopped onion, chillies and spinach to the flour mixture, and toss to coat. You want to make sure that your spinach is chopped up into very small pieces, otherwise your fritters will be hard to handle.

Gradually add your 1 cup of water in small increments to the spinach/flour mixture. Stir to combine. You may not need to use all of the water you have, or you may even need to use more.

Stop adding water once you have achieved a thick batter that can be dolloped into mounds. You don't want a runny batter for these fritters.

Heat a shallow layer of oil in a deep pot and fry fritters for 3 minutes per side, or till a golden brown color is achieved throughout. Drain on paper towels and enjoy!
