![Banana Bread](/recipes/content/images/banana_bread.jpeg)

## Ingredients

- 3 medium overripe bananas
- 70g granulated sugar
- 70g brown sugar
- 78ml vegetable oil
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 250g all-purpose flour
- 5g baking soda
- 5g ground cinnamon
- 5g teaspoon salt
- 100g chopped walnuts (or pecans, or chocolate chips)
- brown sugar to sprinkle on top

## Directions

Preheat the oven to 180&#8451;.

Lightly oil a 9-inch loaf pan and arrange a strip of parchment paper width-wise along the center, with just a bit hanging out over each side.

Peel the bananas and place them into a large mixing bowl. Mash them well with a fork or potato masher.

Add sugar, brown sugar, oil, and vanilla to the bowl. Stir until well-mixed.

Add the flour to the bowl, then sprinkle the baking soda, cinnamon and salt on top of the flour.

Stir everything together just until mixed. Don't over-mix. The batter will be thick.

Fold in the walnuts.

Spoon the batter into the prepared loaf pan and smooth out the top with the back of a spoon.

Sprinkle the top with brown sugar.

Bake for 50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

Remove the pan from the oven and transfer it to a cooling rack.
